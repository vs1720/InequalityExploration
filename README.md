# Data Management and Analysis Project

## 1. Documentation

### HOW TO RUN
All outputs are displayed in notebooks, however, to test you must have credentials to make access string for engine. I have used an init.txt file and I read it as json. So, to test, create a txt file in json format like so (without the <>):

{
"username": "<your_username>",
"password": "<your_password>",
"hostname": "<your_host>",
"database": "<your_database>"
}

Once you have made this file, this notebooks are to be run in the following order:

* [InequalitySelectingFrame](InequalitySelectingFrame.ipynb)
* [DataConsolidation](DataConsolidation.ipynb)
* [Analysis](Analysis.ipynb)
* (optional) [generateDocs](GenerateDocs.ipynb)


### Project Description

The project aims to analyze inequality in countries and how it is related to other economic indicators. 

### Data Source or Description of Data 

Data is taken from a variety of sources in different formats and the unified on a country-year basis. Data comes from the world bank, the United Nations, and Econometric Inequality indices. For sources and description of each column see the next documentation table. 

### Field and / or Columns and Their Types

A value of 0 represents absolute equality, a value of 100 absolute inequality. Gini_disp considers only disposable income as income.  Disposable income, in turn, is gross income minus direct taxes: ‘post-tax, post-transfer’ income.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | index             |

### Selecting an appropriate time frame

We are primarily concerned with inequality, and we want contiguous data. Holes are okay, but we do not want to include, say, year 1965 if there is data for 3 countries in it - it is not statistically sound. So to appropriately pick a solid baseline range, I used seaborn and pandas to visualize data availability in [InequalitySelectingFrame](InequalitySelectingFrame.ipynb)
(This is also one of my new technologies used (I mention it again in the section))

While the notebook is commented and contains info, the basics are:
* See how many countries are available for each year of the data
* Pick an appropriate year range
* Visualize data availability in said range
* Repeat steps 2-4 as needed. 

The final visualization of the data is in [InequalitySelectingFrame](InequalitySelectingFrame.ipynb) last cell.

### Design motivation

The design is a bit non-standard. Since we have data from 4 different main sources, I have 4 different tables for each source. For instance master_un contains the 4 fields from the United Nations data sources. This makes sense as each source has its own range and format of data. However, as a primary key each table has an id which is in format <countrycode>_<year>. All of these are 1 to 1 related to a table called code_year, which has each id's associated year and country code. code_year in turn is related 1-to-1 to a codes table. This could likely have been ommitted but just in case country names change or we add say geographical data unique to country, this is kept. code in turn has a many to 1 relationship with table country_code, which tells which country names correspond to which codes. Because of different data sources, there are different country names, but codes stay the same. For instance the world bank calls Hong Kong, Hong Kong, but the UN calls it Hong Kong, China.

## 3. Data Import and Collection

Data cleaning is an enormous part of this project. One can follow [DataConsolidation](DataConsolidation.ipynb) for full step by step commented transformations, cleaning, and import. but I will summarize here.

* Build a dictionary by going in each source and mapping a country name to a code. This is done with the assistance of a country_code csv and some googling. 
* We then construct inequality dataframe which has country, code, year, and the data corresponding to each country, year pair
* We fill out indices. For instance if there is no data on USA in 2009, we still want it as an index with NaNs because we want to be able to merge it with similarly indexed dataframes which might have data in those fields. 
* Construct tables for world bank, United Nations, and Misc.
* Make several other dataframes to put into SQL - namely code_year, country_code, and code_table
* Make the code_year id that will serve as each column's primary key.
* Use SQLAlchemy to make an engine instance. 
* Convert each of our dtaframes directly to SQL using the to_sql command.
* Add the appropriate primary and foreign key constraints

## 4. Analysis

We want to see what affects inequality, and how inequalityinteracts with other economic indicators, as well as see which countries are most affected by inequality.
